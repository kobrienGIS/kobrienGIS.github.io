# Washington D.C. Educational Attainment Choropleth

## Project description:
This simple choropleth map was created in QGIS using 2020 US Census Bureau ACS data downloaded with tidycensus in RStudio. The variables used were sourced from Table B15003 for Educational Attainment. To visualize the percentage of residents per census tract that had attained at least a bachelor's degree, variables below a bachelor's degree ("No school" to "Associates") were combined into one category, while variables above and including a bachelor's degree ("Bachelors" to "Doctorate") were combined into another. The second category was then computed into a percentage out of the total residents per census tract. The end visualization shows how college education is roughly divided between the East and West of Washington D.C.. In conjunction with the previous two maps, this once again highlights a trend of inequality along racial lines in the District.

This map is part of a series that was originally visualized in a poster documenting chronic inequality in Washington D.C. included here.
