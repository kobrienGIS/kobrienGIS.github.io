## Project description:
This choropleth map was created in QGIS using violent crime rate data sourced from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA) and geographic boundaries borrowed from the Maryland Government. This is simply a quick demonstration of a few style techniques that I have learned that allows me to create high-quality visualizations of geospatial statistics. The time required to create this product was well under an hour.
