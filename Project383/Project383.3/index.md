# Washington D.C. Racial Dot-Density Map

<img src="ges383.3.png?raw=true"/>

## Project description:
This dot-density map was created in QGIS using 2020 US Census Bureau ACS data from Census Reporter and geographic boundaries borrowed from Open Data DC. The variables used were sourced from Table B03002 for Hispanic or Latino Origin by Race. Areas without dots were areas with no data in the 2020 ACS Estimates for Block Groups. The end visualization demonstrates how racially segregated Washington D.C is with respect to the population density and distribution of the three largest racial groups.
