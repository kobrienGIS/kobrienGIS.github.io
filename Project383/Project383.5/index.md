## Project description:
This bivariate choropleth map was created in QGIS using 2020 US Census Bureau ACS data downloaded with tidycensus in RStudio. The variables used were sourced from Table B03002 for Hispanic or Latino Origin by Race. Percentages of the white population and black populations were generated for each census tract and separated into three categories each. The bivariate symbology was then created by blending the % black layer over the % white layer and a legend was created with the Bivariate Legend plugin in QGIS. The end visualization shows how racially divided Washington D.C in the analysis of predominantly white and black census tracts. 

This map is part of a series that was originally visualized in a poster documenting chronic inequality in Washington D.C. included here.
