<img style="border:3px solid black;" src="ukrainerussiaMAP.svg?raw=true"/>

**Project description:** This map is a quick visual representation of the current geopolitical climate in the wake of skyrocketing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The map shows that Ukraine is effectively surrounded on three sides by the hostile states of Russia and Belarus in the North and Northeast, the separatist regions in the East, the Russian occupied Crimean peninsula in the South, and by an unrecognized republic known as Transnistria in the Southwest. Ukraine is caught in the crosshairs and bracing for conflict with many of its major cities including its capital of Kyiv in grave danger.

This map was created in QGIS using open-source spatial data from many different sources online and then exported as a GeoPDF before being edited in Inkscape to include country flags, labels, and a title. As it stands, this map can serve as a template for further edits that could include an estimation of Russian troop movements or position and size. However, given the nature of the conflict, many geographic facts presented in the map may be subject to change as the situation changes. Indeed, for people living in Russia, this map is already outdated as of 2022/02/21 with President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the People's Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk.
