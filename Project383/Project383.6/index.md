# Washington D.C. Median Household Income Choropleth

## Project description:
This binned choropleth map was created in QGIS using 2020 US Census Bureau ACS data downloaded with tidycensus in RStudio. The variables used were sourced from Table B19013 for Median Household Income (MHI) in dollars. Manual bins were generated to neatly separate the data and so that they could later be visualized conveniently in an accompanying histogram. Several tracts contained no MHI estimates and are visualized as such with a legend entry. The end visualization shows how wealth in Washington D.C is roughly divided into the high-income West and low-income East. In conjunction with the previous map, this suggests that wealth is concentrated roughly along racial lines. 

This map is part of a series that was originally visualized in a poster documenting chronic inequality in Washington D.C. included here.
