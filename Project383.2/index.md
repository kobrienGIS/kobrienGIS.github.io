**Project description:** This choropleth map was created in QGIS using violent crime rate data sourced from the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance (BNIA). This is simply a quick demonstration of some style techniques that I hve learned to create high-quality visualizations of geospatial statistics. The time required to create this product was well under an hour.
