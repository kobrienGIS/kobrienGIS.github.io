# Project 1 Documentation:

Note: the following information may be subject to change.

### - What is the **topic**?
I would like to do something that follows my interests that revolve around international politics. If I am able, I would like to locate and use data from an international dataset or a foreign country's census equivalent to research pertinent geopolitical issues. 

### - What are the **data** and where is the data obtained from (provide links too)?
The data would likely be Shapefiles or GeoJSONs of geographic data spanning one or more countries or conflict areas, possibly along with CSVs or other attribute data to provide further information to the presentation. For this I may have to borrow data from international organizations or multiple country cenus equivalents in order to compare and cross-analyze data, especially when such issues are trans-national in nature. 

### - Are there any necessary **transformations or subsets** you need to do to the data?
I would likely need to join informational tables to geographic data in order to convey some additional meaning on top of displaying geographic context. In any case where I may analyze areas at a larger scale I may require smaller subsets of regional data to accomodate. 

### - What is the **analysis** you'll be performing on your data sets?
If I were to try and coorelate two or more variables I could perform some sort of spatial regression or difference of means tests to determine how closely related they are and how much they are influenced by geographic influences. If I were to try and locate clusters of high or low values I could then use spatial autocorellation measures such as Moran's I, Geary's C or Getis-Ord to provide some spatial statistical insights. 

### - What **outputs** will you be creating and how are they directly connected to the class?
I would likely output one or more maps and graphs/charts with coinciding data to support my geographical findings. This will be directly connected to the class as I could use methods that we learned in R, such as ggplot and patchwork to visualize maps and various plots together or I may use QGIS to create advanced visualizations that can be accompanied by data processed in RStudio.
