## Measuring the Efficacy of Government Conservation Efforts on Forest Cover and Health in Protected Areas of the Amazon Rainforest

**Project description:** This project was a small group project that centered on a curiosity about whether the governments of Brazil, Peru, and Columbia were managing their environmental protection areas in the Amazon Rainforest effectively. As part of a remote sensing course, the project utilized Google Earth Engine scripts to extract and process raw Landsat imagery over three decades of study from 2000 to 2010 to 2020 to look for evidence of forest health and proper conservation. The Landsat imagery, taken from Landsats 5, 6, and 7, were put through an array of remote sensing analysis techniques including NDVI to assess overall vegetation health, NBR to locate and compare burn scars, and supervised machine learning classification to create and compare landcover maps for evidence of deforestation.
